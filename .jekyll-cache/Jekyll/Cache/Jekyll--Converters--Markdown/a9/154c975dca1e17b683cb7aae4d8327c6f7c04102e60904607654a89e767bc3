I"<p>After a lot of configuring, I have decided to make my own 
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> based blog,
<br />It is simple, lightweight and has no content except for two brief entries.</p>

<p>I have worked my way through a comprehensive <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">tutorial</a> 
on installing, configuring <br />and using Jekyll to create a simple blog. There is no theme, no real structure
<br />just some basic categories and information.</p>

<p>This blog is 100% dynamic 8-)</p>
