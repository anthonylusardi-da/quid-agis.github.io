The site now works.

Apparently the issue was a conflict between the name of the Github account: quid-agis, and the name of 
the repository that was wanted => quidagis.github.io. According to Github Support, if you want to use 
Github Pages as your personl (User) hosting service, then the username and repository_name must match.

On github.com, edit https://quidagis.github.io -> https://quid-agis.github.io

... 30 minutes later, success.

"Just one little -"
