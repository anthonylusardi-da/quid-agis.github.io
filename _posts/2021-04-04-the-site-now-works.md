The site now works.

Apparently the issue was a conflict between the name of the Github account: quid-agis, and the name of 
the repository that was wanted => quidagis.github.io. According to Github Support, if you want to use 
Github Pages as your personal (User) hosting service, then the username and repository_name *must* match.

On github.com, edit https://quidagis.github.io -> https://quid-agis.github.io

... 30 minutes later, success.

"Just one little -"

Edit: 04/04/2021, 1608hrs, NZST.

The site theme has been altered from 'minima' to 'jekyll-theme-minimal', however after modifying
_config.yaml, installing the new Gems, undating the Bundle, the theme has not changed.

Either locally or remotely on Github Pages. That's a job for tomorrow.
