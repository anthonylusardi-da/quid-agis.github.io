After a lot of configuring, I have decided to make my own 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based blog,
<br>It is simple, lightweight and has no content except for two brief entries.

I have worked my way through a comprehensive [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) 
on installing, configuring <br>and using Jekyll to create a simple blog. There is no theme, no real structure
<br>just some basic categories and information.

This blog is 100% dynamic 8-)
